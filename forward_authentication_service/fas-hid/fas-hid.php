/* (c) Blue Wave Projects and Services 2015-2025. This software is released under the GNU GPL license.

 This is a FAS script designed to provide an http login sequence served from an **Internet hosted** http web server supporting PHP
 It is an example of remote Forward Authentication for openNDS (NDS) that **does not require PHP support on the openNDS router**.
 It is the **http only** version of the example fas-hid scripts.
 It is less secure than the aes encrypted version (fas-aes.php), but with openNDS installed on routers with severe resource limitations, it is more likely to work.

 The following NDS configurations must be set:
 1. fasport: Set to the port number the remote webserver is using (typically port 80)

 2. faspath: This is the path from the FAS Web Root to the location of this FAS script (not from the file system root).
	eg. /nds/fas-hid.php

 3. fasremoteip: The remote IPv4 address of the remote server eg. 46.32.240.41

 4. fasremotefqdn: The fully qualified domain name of the remote web server.
	This is required in the case of a shared web server (ie. a server that hosts multiple domains on a single IP),
	but is optional for a dedicated web server (ie. a server that hosts only a single domain on a single IP).
	eg. onboard-wifi.net

 5. faskey: Matching $key as set in this script (see below this introduction).
	This is a key phrase for NDS to encrypt the query string sent to FAS.
	It can be any combination of A-Z, a-z and 0-9, with no white space.
	eg c775e7b757ede630cd0aa1113bd102661ab38829ca52a6422ab782862f268646

 6. fas_secure_enabled:  set to level 1
	The NDS parameters: clientip, clientmac, gatewayname, hid and redir
	are passed to FAS in the query string.


 This script requires the client user to enter their Fullname and email address. This information is stored in a log file kept
 in /tmp or the same folder as this script.

 This script requests the client CPD to display the NDS splash.jpg image directly from the 
	/etc/opennds/htdocs/images folder of the NDS device.

 This script displays an example Terms of Service. You should modify this for your local legal juristiction
